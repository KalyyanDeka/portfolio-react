Seeking more knowledgein tech industry and my curiosity for new subjects and problem
represent my passion. I love being able to think of a creative idea and making it come
to life by programming it on the screen.

Since technology is changing at a rapid rate, I have been keeping up to date with what 
is happening with current events and where technology will take us 5-10 years down 
line. What I really love about technology is that it is always changing, and that
means that there is always an opportunity to learn something new. I love learning 
new programming languages and frameworks, along with design principles and applying them.
