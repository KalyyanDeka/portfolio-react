          Seeking more knowledge in tech industry and my curiosity for new
          subjects and problem represent my passion. I love being able to think
          of a creative idea and making it come to life by programming it on the
          screen.

        <p className="about__paragraph--3">
          Since technology is changing at a rapid rate, I have been keeping
          myself up to date with what is happening with current events and where
          technology will take us 5-10 years down line. What I really love about
          technology is that it is always changing, and that means that there is
          always an opportunity to learn something new. I love learning new
          programming languages and frameworks, along with design principles and
          applying them.
