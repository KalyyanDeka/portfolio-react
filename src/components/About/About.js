          Well you might already know my name, I am a self-taught fullstack
          developer specialized in Javascript with great experience in using
          technologies such as React, Node.js, Express, Sass, Redux, GraphQL,
          GatsbyJS, Next.js, MongoDB, postgreSQL and more.

          I love being able to think of a creative idea and making it come to
          life by programming it on the screen. My goal is to use my skills to
          develop functional and appealing web-based applications with a focus
          on great user experience, speed and efficiency.

          Since technology is changing at a rapid rate, I have been keeping
          myself up to date with what is happening with current events and where
          technology will take us 5-10 years down the line. What I really love
          about technology is that it is always changing, and that means that
          there is always an opportunity to learn something new. I love learning
          new programming languages and frameworks, along with design principles
          and applying them.
